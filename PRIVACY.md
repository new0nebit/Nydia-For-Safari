# Privacy Policy — Nydia for Safari

Last updated: October 6, 2026

This policy explains how Nydia for Safari handles your information. It will be updated when Nydia's privacy practices change.

## Summary

- **No Nydia account.** You don't need a Nydia account to use the extension.
- **Local storage.** Your passkeys are encrypted and stored on your device.
- **No ads or analytics.** Nydia doesn't automatically send usage statistics or crash reports.
- **No data selling.** Your information isn't sold or used for targeted advertising.
- **Sia backups.** When you back up or sync, encrypted copies go to the Sia network through a server you choose.

Nydia communicates only with websites when you create a passkey or sign in, with your chosen server for backups, and with Google for website icons. The sections below explain what each of them receives.

## What Nydia stores on your device

Nydia saves the following in Safari's local extension storage:

- Your passkeys, including the website, username, and creation date for each.
- An encryption key, so you don't need to enter your recovery phrase each time you use the extension.
- Settings for renterd, the software used to back up to Sia: server address, port, connection type, password, and bucket name.
- Whether you've completed initial setup and which passkeys have been backed up.

Nydia encrypts your passkeys and their details with AES-256-GCM. Renterd settings, including the server password, are saved locally but not encrypted by Nydia.

## Recovery phrase

During setup, Nydia generates a 12-word recovery phrase on your device or lets you enter an existing Nydia phrase. It creates your encryption key from the phrase locally and stores the key, not the phrase itself. Nydia doesn't send your recovery phrase or encryption key outside your device.

To restore backed-up passkeys on a new device or after clearing the extension's storage, you need your recovery phrase, the encrypted backup, and access to the renterd server and bucket where you saved it. Keep your phrase somewhere safe.

## Using passkeys on websites

To create a passkey or find the right one for signing in, Nydia reads the website's passkey request. The request can include the site's address, your username, identifiers for your account and passkeys, and data used to verify the sign-in. Nydia works on websites where you've allowed the extension to run.

When you create a passkey, Nydia gives the website a public key and passkey identifier. When you sign in, it returns a signed response that the website can verify, along with the passkey identifier and the account identifier originally supplied by that website. These are standard WebAuthn responses and never include your private key.

The website can send these responses to its server and keep them under its own privacy policy. Deleting a passkey in Nydia doesn't delete your account or remove the passkey's registration on that website.

## Sia backups

Backups are optional. Nydia contacts your renterd server only when you:

- test or save the connection settings;
- choose **Backup to Sia**, which uploads an encrypted copy of the selected passkey;
- choose **Sync Passkeys**, which uploads passkeys that haven't been backed up yet and downloads backups from your server.

Passkeys are encrypted before they leave your device. Your server stores them as encrypted files with random-looking names and never receives your recovery phrase or encryption key. Like any server, it can see your IP address and when and how much data you transfer. If someone else runs the server, their privacy practices apply, including how long they keep backups and logs.

Nydia tries HTTPS when checking your server connection and uses HTTP if the check fails. Your passkeys remain encrypted either way, but HTTP doesn't protect your server password in transit. For servers outside your local network, use HTTPS.

## Website icons

To show an icon next to a saved passkey, Nydia requests it from Google's favicon service when the passkey list is displayed or refreshed. The request includes the site's domain, sometimes with a subdomain. Google also receives your IP address and the request headers sent by Safari.

These requests don't include usernames, passkey records, private keys, or your recovery phrase. If an icon can't be loaded, Nydia shows a local globe icon.

Nydia doesn't yet have a setting to disable icon requests. Limiting Nydia's website access in Safari doesn't affect them.

Google's handling and retention of this information are covered by its [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Getting help

When you contact support by email, your address and message are used to answer your request. The conversation, including replies, is deleted within 70 days after it's resolved or closed, or earlier if you ask. Support email is handled through iCloud Mail under [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

You can also report problems through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/new0nebit/Nydia-For-Safari/issues). Your GitHub username, message, and attachments are public there, even after an issue is closed. GitHub's handling of information is covered by its [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement). Use email for anything you don't want to post publicly.

## Keeping and deleting your information

Your passkeys, encryption key, and settings stay on your device until you clear the extension's storage. You can also delete individual passkeys. Deleting a local passkey doesn't delete its backup, which **Sync Passkeys** can download again. To delete backups, use your renterd administration tools or contact the server operator.
